# G6PD_project_codes
Code lists used for the project "Prevalence and impact of pathogenic G6PD genetic variants on HbA1c and Type 2 Diabetes diagnosis in UK ethnic groups"

Code lists were used in exclusion critieria for cohort formation and investigation of compilcations. 

Where available, codes were collated from the MULTIPLY-initiative repository of long-term conditions (https://github.com/Fabiola-Eto/MULTIPLY-Initiative/tree/main/MULTIPLY_ICD10_HES/covariables) and Young et al. (https://github.com/drkgyoung/UK_Biobank_codelists)
Where  not available in previous literature, code lists were curated using primary care code lookups provided by the UK BioBank and have been provided here.
