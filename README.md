# G6PD_project_codes
Code lists used for the project "Prevalence and impact of pathogenic G6PD genetic variants on HbA1c and Type 2 Diabetes diagnosis in UK ethnic groups"

Code lists were used in exclusion critieria for cohort formation and investigation of compilcations. 

Where available, codes were collated from the MULTIPLY-initiative repository of long-term conditions (https://github.com/Fabiola-Eto/MULTIPLY-Initiative/tree/main/MULTIPLY_ICD10_HES/covariables), Young et al.(https://github.com/drkgyoung/UK_Biobank_codelists) and Martin S. (https://github.com/susiemartin/G6PD)
Where  not available in previous literature, code lists were curated, with help from Dr Susan Martin using primary care code lookups provided by the UK BioBank and have been provided here. 

ICD codes represent Hospital Episode Statistics, International Classification of Diseases codes, version 9 and 10 respectively. 
Read codes are the codes from UK General Practice, version 2 and 3 respectively.
